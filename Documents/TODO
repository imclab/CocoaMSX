For 1.x:

* Add CAPS and other LED's to status bar
* Machine Editor

Other:
* Change how scanline enabling/disabling is handled - currently clumsy, considering
  that blueMSX can explicitly toggle enable/disable

* Add option to create new disk images
* Figure out a way to copy text to clipboard (read VRAM?)
